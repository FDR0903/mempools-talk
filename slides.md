# Motivation

- Significant volumes on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): ($7.383 billion in 24 hours) as of 7 May 2025

- DEX efficiency actively influences discussions on blockchain design

# Motivation: the blockchain protocol
The blockchain protocol determines the lifecycle of transactions and adds new cost structures

# Motivation: the blockchain protocol
The blockchain protocol determines the lifecycle of transactions and adds new cost structures

* Transactions are sent to the network continuously, and stored in a memory pool
* At each Epoch, with length block time, a validator is chosen
* The validator creates a new block with transactions from the memory pool

![blockchain1](./images/blockchaincreation3.png){style="transform: translate(20%, 0%); width: 680px"}

---

# Motivation: the blockchain protocol

### Gas fees (EIP-1559)
* **Base fee**: based on congestion, prerequisite for inclusion
* **Priority fee**: incentivise validators to prioritise a transaction in the block

# Blockchain protocol: consequences

#### Pre-trade transparency
* Agents observe pending and unconfirmed transactions

<br />

#### Priority gas auctions
* Agents submit/revise priority fees to compete for queue priority

# Results: price discovery

### Slow Information Dissemination in Blockchains

- Information is disseminated at the end of block time, when markets clear  
- In contrast to continuous information flow in traditional exchanges  
  _(Kyle, 1985; Huddart, Hughes, and Levine, 2001)_

# Results: block time and market efficiency

* Longer block time increases speculative rewards
   *  incentive to acquire private information $\implies$ prices are more efficient

---

# Results: block time and market efficiency

* Longer block time increases speculative rewards
   *  incentive to acquire private information $\implies$ prices are more efficient
   * more adverse selection costs for liquidity suppliers $\implies$ defensive liquidity supply

* Non-zero bids decrease expected terminal wealth

$\implies$ no trader has incentive to bid early in the online auction
* In equilibrium: traders delay bidding until the last moment

# Stage two: the online auction

# Stage two: trading volumes

Substitute the priority fee, trader $i$ solves
$$
\sup_{\delta_{i}}\Bigg\{F\left(v_i\right)^{M-1}\,\left(-\varphi_{i}+M\,\delta_{i}^{2}/\kappa\right)-(1+M)\,\delta_{i}^2/\kappa^{2}+\delta_{i}\,\left(v_i-\pi\right)\Bigg\}
$$

The linear-quadratic programme is interpreted as follows 
* Trading costs increase with trading volume 
    1. the execution cost $-\delta_i^2/\kappa$, 
    2. the price impact cost $M\,\delta_i^2 \left(1 - F\left(v_i\right)^{M-1}\right)/\kappa$
    3. The AMM's proportional transaction fee $\pi\,\delta_i$. 
* Inventory: incentive for trader $i$ to increase  holdings $\delta_i$ 

---

# Stage two: trading volumes

In equilibrium, trader $i$ transacts a volume
$$
\delta(v_i)=\kappa\,\tilde{\delta}(v_i)=\kappa\,\frac{v_i-\pi}{2\,\left(1+M\left(1-F\left(v_{i}\right)^{M-1}\right)\right)}\,
$$
* Trader $i$'s  volume $\delta_i$ is a fraction $\tilde\delta(v)$ of the liquidity supply $\kappa$

* The fraction $\tilde\delta_i$ increases in the  signal
    1. the signal $v_i$ is the expected liquidation value
    2. likelihood of winning the auction at lower cost increases

* Trader $i$'s  volume $\delta_i$ is a fraction $\tilde\delta(v)$ of the liquidity supply $\kappa$
* The fraction $\tilde\delta_i$ increases in the  signal
    1. the signal $v_i$ is the expected liquidation value
    2. likelihood of winning the auction at lower cost increases
* For fixed $v_i$, $\tilde\delta_i$ decrease in competitors' signal dispersion
    * signal dispersion increases the probability $1-F(v_i)^{M-1}$ to lose the auction

$$
\delta(v_i)=\kappa\,\tilde{\delta}(v_i)=\kappa\,\frac{v_i-\pi}{2\,\left(1+M\left(1-F\left(v_{i}\right)^{M-1}\right)\right)}\,
$$
* $\delta(v_i)$ decreases to zero when $M\rightarrow\infty$
* The equilibrium priority fee $\varphi(\delta(v))$, **accounting for strategically adjusted trading volumes** is
    $$
    \varphi(\delta_i) = \varphi(\delta(v_i))
    $$
    * $\varphi(\delta(v_i))$ decreases to zero when $M\rightarrow\infty$

# Stage two: trading volumes

- Higher values of private signals correspond to larger trading volumes

- They are also associated with higher priority fees and better queue positions.

Stage one: liquidity supply <a name="defi"></a></h1>
</p>

---

# Stage one: liquidity supply -- assumptions

- A risk-neutral liquidity supplier sets the supply $\kappa$ with rational expectations over behaviour of informed traders. They balance
    1. losses to informed traders 
    2. fee revenue earned from uninformed liquidity traders

---

# Stage one: liquidity supply -- assumptions

Uninformed liquidity traders transact a net volume that sums to zero but an absolute volume $N$ which is elastic.
- liquidity demanded by buyers $\frac{N}{2}\,\left(1-\theta/\kappa\right)\,,$
- liquidity demanded by buyers $-\frac{N}{2}\,\left(1-\theta/\kappa\right)\,,$

Elasticity: increasing the ask $1/\kappa$ by $s$ reduces demand by $\theta\,s \,N/2$

Standard framework: Garman (1976); Ho and Stoll (1981); Hendershott and Menkveld (2014)

---

# Stage one: liquidity supply -- assumptions

- The liquidity supplier assumes that with probability $1/2,$ informed traders are buyers, and with probability $1/2,$ they are sellers
- From the perspective of the supplier, total trading volume of informed traders $\Delta$ is a random variable with mean zero.

- The liquidity supplier assumes that with probability $1/2,$ informed traders are buyers, and with probability $1/2,$ they are sellers
- From the perspective of the supplier, total trading volume of informed traders $\Delta$ is a random variable with mean zero.
- Expected losses to informed traders
$$
-  \mathbb E\left[\Delta^2\right] / \kappa   = - M\, \mathbb{V}\left[{\delta}_{i}\right] \big/\kappa   =  - M\, \mathbb{V}[\tilde{\delta}_{i}]\,.
$$

- Fee revenue
$$

# Stage one: liquidity supply

The equilibrium supply of liquidity is 
$$
\kappa=\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,N\,\theta}{M\,\mathbb{V}[\tilde{\delta}_i]}}
$$
Recall
$$
\tilde\delta(v_i)=\frac{v_i-\pi}{2\,\left(1+M\left(1-F\left(v_{i}\right)^{M-1}\right)\right)}
$$

* The liquidity supply increases in the profitability of the uninformed trading flow
* The liquidity supply decreases in the variance of signals

# Stage one: liquidity supply

- The liquidity supply **increases in the number of competing informed traders**

Block time has two opposing effects
1. volatile trading signals drive liquidity levels down 
2. liquidity demand accumulates $\rightarrow$ drive liquidity levels up

The equilibrium payoff of liquidity provision

$$\pi\,N-2\,\sqrt{M\,\pi\,N\,\theta\,\mathbb{V}[\tilde{\delta}_{i}]}$$

* For fixed liquidity demand $N$, there is a limit to block time above which markets shut down (Glosten and Milgrom (1985))
$$

- Price efficiency is directly related to the number of informed traders who pay the cost of acquiring information
$$
\mathbb V[\hat V \mid \{v_1, \dots, v_M\}] = \frac{L - M}{L^2}\, \mathbb V[v] + \sigma^2,

- Similar goal to that in Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) for traditional markets

# Effect of block time and priority fees

* Consider the case where $\tilde G$, the CDF of $\tilde\delta$, is uniform over $[0, D/M]$ with probability $1/2$ and $[-D/M, 0]$ with probability $1/2$

* $D$ is proportional to signal dispersion
    * Longer block times $\equiv$ larger values of $D$

# Automated Market Makers
### Transaction costs

* Change in wealth of LPs
$$
-\left(\Phi(y) - \Phi(y-\Delta y) - \Phi'(y)\,\Delta y\right) \approx - \frac12\, \Phi''(y)\, \Delta y^2

* LPs earn proportional fees $\pi$

# Automated Market Makers
### Transaction costs

* Convexity determines transaction costs

* Convexity is inversely proportional to the size of the pool

$$ \kappa = 2 / \Phi''(y) $$

* Liquidity providers set the size of the pool

$$ \text{Slippage } = \delta /\kappa  $$

$$  \ \ \ \, \  \text{Impact }= 2 \, \delta /\kappa  $$

$$ \quad \ \ \, \text{LP loss } = - \delta^2 / \kappa  $$
